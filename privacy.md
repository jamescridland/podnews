**Correction Policy**

We welcome requests for correction or clarification to updates@podnews.net.

At our discretion, we may update the original article, including publicly updating the last-modified date (in schema as 'dateModified'). We do not explicitly highlight corrections nor retain incorrect text on archived articles. If it's a correction we feel we should highlight, we'll do so in the next available newsletter, hyperlinked to the amended page.

**Privacy Policy**

We collect email addresses for our newsletter using our own newsletter server. The email list is not available to any third party. We will not use your email address for any purpose other than to send you the newsletter that you have subscribed to. We have an unsubscribe button on every single mailing.

When subscribing using the website, we require double opt-in, to ensure that the email address is yours. We also passively collect your country, obtained from your IP address.

In common with many newsletters, we monitor open rates (so we know when/if you open the newsletter), and may monitor clicks on each story on both the web and emails (so we know which story you find interesting). We do not give any personally-identifiable data about you or your behaviour to any third party. We may aggregate information in a non-personal way for current/potential advertisers, or for bragging rights.

You can unsubscribe directly from every newsletter. That will instantly stop emails to you, and send you user account deletion information.

We use AMP Project framework code, served by Google. You can read Google's [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

We use Amazon AWS infrastructure to cache, host and serve this site and our podcast, including Amazon's domain-name services and to send emails. You can read their [privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). We collect site logs including IP addresses and user-agents for technical and budgetary reasons. 

Podnews is hosted within the EU. We use a mixture of EU and US-based email servers. Received email is mirrored on global infrastructure operated by a variety of organisations.

Our classified advertising system collects your email address. It uses Stripe to collect payments; when you pay by credit card, your address, zip code, IP address and other personal details are collected by Stripe. Much of that data is available to us in Stripe's dashboard (though we can't see your full credit card number). [Here's Stripe's privacy policy](https://stripe.com/au/privacy).

Audio files played on our podcast pages are referenced directly from the podcast provider.

**Cookies**

To read Podnews (on our website or in email) we do not require cookies.

We use Google Analytics to monitor visit numbers and user behaviour. We remove data in Google Analytics after 26 months; the AMP code we use anonymises IP addresses by default. You can learn about Google Analytics' [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) and opt out of Google Analytics completely by using [this tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You can also use your browser in "private" or "incognito" mode to look like a brand new user every time you browse the web.

Our classified advertising system does use personal cookies so we know who you are, and we clearly ask for your consent as you log in. These cookies are only visible to our website to pages within the /classifieds/ folder, and are otherwise discarded by our CDN before they're visible at our origin server.

**For podcast listeners**

This section is intended for listeners of the Podnews podcast, which is available on a variety of third-party platforms.

Most apps or devices download our audio directly from our server. In this interaction, in its entirety, we get to know five things about you:

1. Your device's user agent (the name of the app you're using, and often the type of device you're connecting with).
2. Sometimes we learn a referral address, showing us the website or path you took to listen to the podcast.
3. Your IP address. This is a 12-digit number, from which it is possible to work out your approximate location, often down to your suburb, and the name of your ISP or mobile provider. Sometimes it's possible to work out your employer or school from an IP address.
4. The date and time of the download.
5. What file you downloaded, and whether you downloaded all of it or just a little bit.

We do not give this data to any third party, and use this data for our own analysis as part of our log files.

We also use Chartable to monitor our podcast downloads. They have a [separate privacy policy](https://chartable.com/privacy) to read.

Whatever app you listen on, your playback data may also be collected by that app, and you should check the privacy policy of the podcast app that you use.

**Feeds**

We have a full RSS feed at [https://podnews.net/rss](https://podnews.net/rss). It's intended for personal use. It also functions as our podcast feed, with audio enclosures. Audio is normally around three minutes, and uses broadcast-friendly language: it is suitable for rebroadcast with permission.

We have a very simple JSON feed of our last published update (headline and link) at [https://podnews.net/json](https://podnews.net/json). We use this for cross-promotion.

**Copyright and terms of use**

This website is copyright &copy; Podnews LLC. Reproduction is prohibited without our written permission.

Information you submit to us with the intention of being published is deemed to be licensed to us for our use.

Information is provided "as is" without any warranty as to accuracy, quality or fitness for purpose. You use this website at your own risk.

**Updates to this policy**

23 Sep 2019: No material changes to the privacy policy; we updated the website visit numbers and email geographic breakdown, and added a new advertising sales email address. PS: the total subscriber number in this page will now always update.

16 July 2019: Podnews is now legally published by Podnews LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. This has otherwise meant no changes to our privacy policy or hosting infrastructure. We've also taken the time to clarify the countries in which our physical infrastructure is located.

10 June 2019: We added a "for podcast listeners" section, making our use of Chartable clear.

4 June 2019: We removed a paragraph about Google AdSense use: we've not had AdSense on this website for over twelve months. We also have corrected our site log collection policy.
