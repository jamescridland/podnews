### Submissions

We accept story or podcast submissions via email to [updates@podnews.net](mailto:updates@podnews.net)

We do not seek payment to cover any story. You can buy [classified advertising](https://podnews.net/classifieds) for extra visibility; but we do not see any placed classified advertising during our editorial process, and are ignorant of the contents of this section until completion of each daily edition.

Things that really help us when submitting stuff:
* **Photographs.** We really like large, landscape, photographs (or links to them). Your big Twitter banner image might be up our street. If you don't give us any artwork, we might do some [poor](https://podnews.net/update/anchor-tos) [visual](https://podnews.net/press-release/himalaya-launch) [puns](https://podnews.net/update/anchor-money-making-podcasts). 
* **No, not logos.** We don't want a logo. We don't want your square podcast artwork. Photographs that have people in them work best. 
* **PDF releases.** We like those (though make sure the text is copyable). If text has links or other formatting, we'll often use that.
* **Everything we need to do our job in one email.** We work in a different timezone to you (probably), so if you tell us "photos on request!" or "are you interested in this [random one line story] so I can send you a press release?" then you've just added a 24 hour delay.

(We're not being picky, by the way - this is what all journalists would like!)

We always respect embargoes. Bear in mind that we publish at 2100 GMT -10 (6am winter, 7am summer New York time), so if you give us an embargo for 8am New York time, a) we'll be sad, and b) it'll be old news by the time we publish it the next day.

We always respect requested anonymity.

### When submitting a podcast:
* Give us an editorial reason to feature you. A new launch, or a new season? Something technically interesting?
* We'll typically only feature you once per season, unless there's a really good reason.
* You've got to be in Apple Podcasts. If you're not there, "you're not a podcast" (so they say).
* If your podcast trailer is less than a minute long, we may include it at the end of our podcast (we'll grab it from your feed). If you don't want us to promote your podcast in this way, please tell us.

### Things we don't cover

We give no guarantee that we'll actually cover anything, of course: inclusion is our decision based on whether it's interesting for our readers. But particularly, because it's illegal in the majority of countries and because it will have adverse effect on email delivery to corporates, we're afraid that we do not cover "potcasts" about cannabis or medical marijuana. (We'll tweet them if you send us details, but that's as far as it goes). We're sorry about that.

### Commercial clashes
We do not see classified advertising until the end of the editorial process, after each newsletter has been written. We're editorially ignorant of the contents of our classified advertising block.

Sponsors and supporters are not given any editorial control of stories within the main newsletter, nor given any guarantee we'll cover a story. Podnews may carry sponsored content as separate stories, and the relationship between us and that company will be clearly marked.

We have a cost-neutral partnership package with event and conference organisers where we help promote their events with a mix of paid classifieds and editorial mentions. They have no control over the content of any editorial mention.
