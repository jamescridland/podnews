We use Amazon AWS infrastructure to cache, host and serve this site and our podcast, including Amazon’s domain-name services and to send emails.

When posting a new job, we collect and validate your email address.

To read podjobs, we do not require the use of cookies.

We use Google Analytics to monitor visit numbers and user behaviour. We remove data after 26 months; the AMP code we use anonymises IP addresses by default.

You can also use your browser in “private” or “incognito” mode to look like a brand new user every time you browse the web.

When posting a job, we use personal cookies so we know who you are, and we clearly ask for your consent as you log in. These cookies are only visible to our website to pages with URLs starting "add", and are otherwise discarded by our CDN before they’re visible at our origin server.
